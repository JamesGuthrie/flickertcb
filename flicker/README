You can ruin your motherboard on Intel hardware if your BIOS is
buggy. See the Intel section below.

Introduction
############

Flicker is a technique to execute a piece of application logic (PAL)
code with an extremely small TCB [1], while maintaining compatibility
with a legacy operating system.  Flicker requires that the computer
have support for dynamic root of trust.  The legacy operating system
for this version is 32-bit non-PAE Linux, or 32-bit non-PAE Windows 7.
It is assumed that you have read the EuroSys paper [1].

Prerequisites
=============

Hardware
--------

To use Flicker, a PC platform supporting dynamic root of trust is
needed.  AMD and Intel have implemented this differently. A v1.2 TPM
is also required (and it must be enabled and activated in the BIOS).

The AMD version of Flicker requires a processor supporting the SKINIT
instruction, a v1.2 TPM [2], and a chipset which provides memory
protection for the Flicker code.  The SKINIT instruction is available
with newer AMD64 processors [3]. Look for 'svm' in /proc/cpuinfo. In
the BIOS, you must enable hardware virtualization support.

The Intel version of Flicker requires a processor supporting the
GETSEC[SENTER] instruction, a v1.2 TPM [2], and a chipset which
provides memory protection for the Flicker code.  These features are
available on vPro-branded systems supporting Intel Trusted eXecution
Technology (TXT) [6]. Look for 'smx' and 'vmx' in /proc/cpuinfo. In
BIOS, you must enable hardware virtualization support (VT), Trusted
eXecution Technology (TXT), and VT-d. There are known-bad (really bad;
you could RUIN YOUR MOTHERBOARD) BIOSes out there for TXT.  Upgrade
your BIOS to the newest available version.

To verify that your system has a v1.2 TPM:
$ modprobe tpm_tis force=1 interrupts=0
$ cat `find /sys -name pcrs`

You should have 24 PCRs listed (0-23).  If you have only 16 PCRs
(0-15), then you have a v1.1b TPM, and Flicker won't work.

Software
--------

You must use a non-PAE Linux kernel.  If your system has multiple
gigabytes of memory there is a good chance your Linux installer
configured a PAE kernel.  If the output of `uname -a` includes pae,
you need to use a different kernel. Multiprocessor systems are
supported.

Intel hardware requires a chipset-specific SINIT (aka Authenticated
Code) module, which can be obtained from the tboot project's web page
[7].

Windows requirements can be found in ./kmod/windows/README.txt.  In
short, you must change the boot configuration to be non-PAE and
uniprocessor.

Executing a Flicker session
###########################

Build the kmod in the kmod/ subdirectory.  Note that you need to have
the headers installed for your kernel.  Investigate 'apt-get install
linux-headers-[version]' or similar.

cd kmod/
ln -s Makefile.linux Makefile
make

Build the pal by invoking 'make' in the pal/ subdirectory.

Cross your fingers and execute ./go.sh.

The source files are reasonably well commented.  Go read the code. :)

Intel-specific requirements
===========================

MAKE SURE YOUR BIOS IS UP TO DATE.  In particular, if you have an HP
8530p, executing this code with BIOS version F.09 WILL RUIN YOUR
MOTHERBOARD.  We have performed successful tests with version F.0E.
Others have reported similar problems with various hardware on the
tboot-devel mailing list.

Start by testing Intel's tboot [7] on your system.  Go to the tboot
page [7], download the code, and follow its README.  If tboot won't
work, Flicker won't either. You will likely end up with an SINIT
module in your /boot directory, which is a requirement for Flicker.
If you have an Intel system, and email for help, our first question
will be whether you have tried tboot.

Components
##########

:kmod:
  OS-specific drivers to support Flicker.
:kmod/intel:
  Code specific to systems with Intel processors.
:kmod/linux:
  Linux driver.
:kmod/windows:
  Windows driver.  See kmod/windows/README.txt.
:kmod/amd:
  Code specific to systems with AMD processors.
:pal:
  CPU-agnostic and OS-agnostic PAL with printf, "hash trick", and TPM
  support.
:common:
  Some common structure definitions that need to be consistent between
  the driver and the PAL.

FAQ
###

: Will Flicker run on my machine? :

  If it meets the Prerequisites above, Flicker _should_ run.  However,
  it has only been tested on machines that we have access to.

: I don't have a Flicker-capable machine. Can I still develop a
  Flicker module? :

  Yes, AMD's SimNow [8] supports the SKINIT instruction.  However,
  there will be no TPM support included.  In fact, we have encountered
  machines in the wild that will execute SKINIT but do not include a
  TPM.  These can be useful for developing application-specific
  functionality without requiring a reboot during a debug cycle.

: I want to buy a machine to run Flicker. What should I buy? :

  The AMD version has been tested on:

  HP ProBook 6555b
  Dell PowerEdge T105 server
  Dell Optiplex 740 workstation
  HP dc5750 workstation - runs but buggy - not recommended

  The Intel version has been tested on:

  HP dc7800 workstation
  Dell Optiplex 755 workstation
  Lenovo T400 laptop
  HP 8530p laptop  
  HP 8540p laptop
  HP Elite 8100 desktop
  HP 2540p laptop

: Is Flicker bug-free? :

  Certainly not in this version.  At this point Flicker most decidedly
  remains an academic prototype.  However, its architecture and small
  size suggest that a bug-free implementation may be attainable by
  buggy human beings. :) Known problems include excessive I/O
  permissions to ring 3 PAL code, excessive memory access by PAL
  segment descriptors due to need to access the TPM from ring 3
  without system calls, and a failure to expand DMA protections beyond
  those put in place automatically by SKINIT / SENTER.


Known Issues
############

The current implementation will cause your Linux system to "lose
time."  I.e., after invoking numerous Flicker sessions, your system
clock will appear to have drifted backwards.  Certain devices do not
like to have their interrupts left pending for the entire Flicker
session, and may cause the system to be unstable.

AMD-specific
============

The HP dc5750 contains a buggy south bridge, that prevents the CPU
from successfully sending the contents of the SLB to the TPM for
hashing.  The measurement that ends up in PCR 17 may appear to be
random and unrelated to the actual SLB, and will not be consistent
across invocations.  No fix available.

Intel-specific
==============

Invoking GETSEC[SENTER] with BIOS version F.09 on an HP 8530p laptop
will ruin the motherboard by sending the machine into an endless loop
of reboots.  Update your BIOS before even thinking about trying this
code. HP includes instructions on how to attempt recovery, but they
did not work for us:
http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?objectID=c01658899&lang=en&cc=us&taskId=135&prodSeriesId=3688868&prodTypeId=321957

Though we have not tested this ourselves, it has been reported (on the
tboot-devel mailing list) that the Intel DQ45CB motherboard exhibits a
similar reboot loop.  We are unaware of a workaround at this time,
though a good place to start is to look for a newer BIOS version.

Attempting to use this Flicker code with an SINIT module older than
version 17 will prevent the invocation of multiple Flicker sessions
during a single boot cycle.  I.e., upon attempting to invoke a second
Flicker session during a single boot cycle, the system will reset.
Using tboot on the subsequent boot cycle to read LT.ERRORCODE will
reveal progress code 0f and error code 1110: "Current values of VT-d
PMR registers do not match requested values in SinitMleData." This can
be worked around in software but it is better to simply use a newer
SINIT module.


250-line TCB in flicker-0.1
###########################

This release does not include the code from flicker-0.1 due to the
licensing change from GPL to BSD-style.  Version 0.1 remains available
on the Flicker project web page at CMU:
http://sparrow.ece.cmu.edu/group/flicker.html

Acknowledgements
################

We are grateful to Bernhard Kauer at TU Dresden for the OSLO project
[5] which helped get Flicker started.  Leendert van Doorn at AMD
provided encouragement to make the TCB smaller as far back as 2004. He
and Elsie Wahlig provided essential hardware support. Ed Schwartz
helped find bugs in the Intel code. Everybody on the tboot-devel
mailing list has been extremely supportive and encouraging.
